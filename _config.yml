  Hey, I'm Kat. I'm currently working as a software engineer for Neo Financial in Calgary, Alberta. In January 2019 I graduated from Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp, and then spent 7 months helping them build their presence in Calgary. But now it is time to get my hands dirty and write my own code.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
